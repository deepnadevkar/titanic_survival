# titanic_survival

This repo contains the titanic dataset (also available on kaggle). 

I do some basic data visualization (using matplotlib and seaborn) to understand which features are important. 

Then, I run a logistic regression (using scikit-learn) to predict the survival of titanic passengers. 

Have a look at the ipython notebook to find out more! The results are pretty interesting!
